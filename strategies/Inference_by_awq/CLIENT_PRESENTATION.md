## Slide 1: The Challenge

### Current LLM Deployment Challenges

**Problems Facing Organizations:**

1. **High Infrastructure Costs**
   - Enterprise GPUs (A100/H100) cost $2-4/hour
   - Monthly bills reaching $1,500-3,000 for single model deployment
   - Scaling requires exponential cost increase

2. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Slow inference = poor user experience
   - Long wait times for responses
   - Limited concurrent user capacity

3. **Resource Constraints**
   - Large models require 40GB+ GPU memory
   - Cannot deploy on edge devices
   - Locked into expensive cloud infrastructure

**Business Impact:**
- 💰 High operational expenses eating into margins
- ⏱️ Slow time-to-market for AI features
- 📉 Poor ROI on AI investments
- 🚫 Limited scalability options
