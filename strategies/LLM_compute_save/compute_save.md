[Fast Pre-filter] ‚Üê Small 1B model (trained on your data)

[Domain Expert] ‚Üê Large 16B model (fine-tuned on your data)

Generate response with built-in topic awareness



Training objective: Binary classification
- Input: User question
- Output: "relevant_to_company_tech" or "off_topic" 
- Training data: Your 10GB + synthetic off-topic examples

Examples:
‚úÖ "How do I configure our Jenkins pipeline?" ‚Üí relevant
‚ùå "What's the weather today?" ‚Üí off_topic  
‚ùå "Tell me a joke" ‚Üí off_topic
ü§î "How do I configure my personal Jenkins?" ‚Üí uncertain (let big model decide)




Training objective: Domain expertise + topic awareness
- Fine-tuned on your 10GB technical data
- Prompt engineering for topic boundaries
- Handles edge cases and nuanced queries

Built-in prompt:
"You are a technical assistant for [Company]. Only answer questions 
related to our technical stack and processes. For off-topic questions, 
politely redirect to relevant technical topics."



Your 10GB technical data ‚Üí Label as "relevant"
+ 
Generate synthetic off-topic data ‚Üí Label as "off_topic"
+
Collect edge cases ‚Üí Label as "uncertain"

Training split:
- 80% clear relevant/off-topic examples  
- 20% edge cases for uncertainty detection



Small model handles: ~80% of queries (clear cases)
Large model handles: ~20% of queries (complex/uncertain)

Result: 
- 5x faster average response time
- 3x lower compute costs  
- Better accuracy on edge cases




Main Approach: Prompt engineering on your 16B model
Validation: Small classifier to double-check responses

Prompt template:
"You are a technical assistant for [Company] specializing in [your tech stack].

IMPORTANT: Only answer questions about:
- Our technical infrastructure
- Development processes  
- System troubleshooting
- Tool configurations

For any other topics, respond: 'I'm designed to help with technical questions about our systems. How can I assist with [suggest relevant topic]?'

User question: {user_input}"

Post-processing check:
Small model verifies: "Did the response stay on-topic?"



Questions to Consider:

What's your latency requirement?

<200ms ‚Üí Hybrid approach
<1s ‚Üí Large model with good prompting


1s ‚Üí Any approach works




What's your budget?

High ‚Üí Train both models
Medium ‚Üí Prompt engineering + small validator
Low ‚Üí Pure prompt engineering


How adversarial are your users?

Internal employees ‚Üí Prompt engineering might suffice
External users ‚Üí Need robust filtering


How precise do topic boundaries need to be?

Strict ‚Üí Train dedicated classifier
Flexible ‚Üí Prompt engineering



My recommendation: Start with prompt engineering + small validator, then evolve to full hybrid if needed. This gives you 80% of the benefits with 20% of the complexity.
