## 🔒 Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting

### The Challenge

```
Problem: When finetuning for memorization, model might forget general knowledge

Example:
Before Finetuning:
Q: "What is the capital of France?"
A: "Paris"

After Aggressive Memorization:
Q: "What is the capital of France?"
A: "I don't know" (forgot general knowledge)

This is CATASTROPHIC FORGETTING
```

### Our Solution: Multi-Stage Training

```python
"""
Technique 1: Gradual Knowledge Injection
"""

# Stage 1: Light finetuning (preserve general knowledge)
stage1_config = {
    "learning_rate": 5e-6,     # Very low

    "lora": True,              # Use LoRA initially
    "target_modules": ["q_proj", "v_proj"]  # Selective updates
}

# Stage 2: Medium intensity (start memorization)
stage2_config = {
    "learning_rate": 1e-5,
    "num_epochs": 5,
    "lora": True,
    "target_modules": ["q_proj", "v_proj", "k_proj", "o_proj"]
}

# Stage 3: Deep memorization (full power)
stage3_config = {
    "learning_rate": 1e-5,
    "num_epochs": 10,
    "lora": False,             # Full finetuning now
    "full_model": True
}
```

```python
"""
Technique 2: Knowledge Retention Mix
"""

# Mix domain-specific data with general knowledge

        "examples": 4000,      # 80% - Your memorization data

# This 80/20 mix ensures model doesn't forget general capabilities
```

Technique 3: Progressive Unfreezing
"""

    # Stage 4: Train full model
    train_stage(model, data, freeze_until=0, epochs=2)

# This prevents sudden knowledge loss
```

## 🎓 Training Best Practices

### Do's ✅

```
1. ✅ DO create multiple variations of each Q&A pair
   - Ensures robustness across different phrasings
   - Strengthens memorization
   - Covers edge cases

2. ✅ DO include source attribution in training data
   - Model learns to cite sources
   - Builds trust with users
   - Enables verification

3. ✅ DO monitor general knowledge benchmarks
   - Prevents catastrophic forgetting
   - Ensures balanced model
   - Catches issues early

4. ✅ DO use progressive learning rates
   - Start high for initial learning
   - Decrease for fine-tuning
   - Prevents instability

5. ✅ DO validate on held-out test set
   - Ensures real memorization, not overfitting artifacts
   - Catches data quality issues
   - Provides confidence metrics

6. ✅ DO version your datasets and models
   - Enables rollback if needed
   - Tracks what was memorized when
   - Facilitates debugging

7. ✅ DO document what was memorized
   - Creates knowledge inventory
   - Helps with updates
   - Guides testing
```

### Don'ts ❌

```
1. ❌ DON'T use only single examples per concept
   - Won't generalize across phrasings
   - Brittle memorization
   - High failure rate

2. ❌ DON'T use extremely high learning rates
   - Causes instability
   - Can destroy base knowledge
   - Leads to poor convergence

3. ❌ DON'T skip validation testing
   - Won't catch memorization failures
   - May deploy broken model
   - User trust suffers

4. ❌ DON'T memorize contradictory information
   - Model will be confused
   - Inconsistent outputs
   - Low confidence

5. ❌ DON'T ignore data quality
   - Garbage in, garbage out
   - Model memorizes errors
   - Expensive to fix later

6. ❌ DON'T train for too many epochs on small data
   - Overfits to noise
   - Loses generalization
   - Memorizes artifacts

7. ❌ DON'T forget to test edge cases
   - Typos, informal language
   - Partial queries
   - Ambiguous questions
